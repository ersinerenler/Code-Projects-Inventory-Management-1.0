# Overview
+ Code-Projects Inventory Management V1.0 is susceptible to a significant security vulnerability that arises from insufficient protection on the 'id'parameter in the deleteProduct.php file. This flaw can potentially be exploited to inject malicious SQL queries, leading to unauthorized access and extraction of sensitive information from the database.
# Vulnerability Details
+ CVE ID: CVE-2023-46582
+ Affected Version: Code-Projects Inventory Management V1.0
+ Vulnerable File: /deleteProduct.php
+ Parameter Name: id 
+ Attack Type: Local
# References:
+ https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-46582
+ https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46582
# Description
+ The lack of proper input validation and sanitization on the 'id' parameter allows an attacker to craft SQL injection queries, bypassing authentication mechanisms and gaining unauthorized access to the database

# Proof of Concept (PoC) : 
+ Login with admin
+ Go to Products page
+ Send a delete request for a product
+ Intercept the request via Burp Suite
+ Copy and paste the request to a request.txt file
+ Then use sqlmap to exploit
+ `sqlmap -r request.txt -p id --risk 3 --level 5 --dbms mysql --batch --current-db`

```
